# Accordion

Bootstrap accordions allow you to vertically collapse and expand content sections. Perfect for FAQs, navigation menus, and more.

## Overview

The accordion uses the Bootstrap collapse JavaScript plugin to show and hide content. Each accordion item contains a header button that controls the visibility of its associated content panel.

## Examples

### Default Accordion

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} />

### Flush Accordion

Remove borders and rounded corners to render accordions edge-to-edge with their parent container.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Flush} />

## Props

<Controls of={AccordionStories.Default} />
